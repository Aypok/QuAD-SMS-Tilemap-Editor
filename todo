A list of bugs that need fixing. Also includes some new features that'd be useful. Not really in any order...

 -> Split the huge code file in to separate class files. Maybe make the naming less stupid, too. Maybe. :)
 -> Include sample Z80 assembly on how to use the output.
 -> Fix the scrollbars in zoom x2 and zoom x4 modes.
 -> Add way to clear the tiles.
 -> The "Area Shown" label does not update when the window is resized - only when the scrollbars are used.
 -> On the "Export Tilemap" window, the label "Bytes Per Line" should read "Tiles Per Line".
 -> Limiting the tiles per line will omit and discard the remaining tiles from that line and does not wrap around.
 -> Setting the tile flags are not shown on the tile or tilemap displays.
 -> Add pop-up warning when importing an image which uses too many unique tiles.
 -> Allow click-and-drag functionality for pasting tiles.
 -> Allow creation of "meta tiles" (groups of 8x8 tiles working together as one larger tile, making it easy to repeat patterns).
 -> Some way to display non-visible properties of tiles (such as "above sprites").
 -> When the "flip tiles" attribute is set on tiles, actually flip them.
